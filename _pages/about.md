<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Transdisciplinary Medicine and the Healthcare AI Research Institute at Seoul National University Hospital and Seoul National University College of Medicine. I also serve as the professor in charge of the Center for Data Innovation at the [National Strategic Technology Research Institute](https://nstri-en.snuh.org/), where I work to build the [Korea Health Data Platform](https://khdp.net) for global collaboration. I was selected as an [Emerging Young Investigator](http://www.bosa.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=2236647) by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea in 2024. In 2025, I joined the editorial team of [*npj Digital Medicine*](https://www.nature.com/npjdigitalmed/), the leading medical AI journal (IF 15.2, JCR top 1%), as an associate editor.

My research interests include biosignal processing, natural language processing (large language models), reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems. I apply these methods to multimodal clinical data such as biosignals, clinical texts, medical imaging, and electronic health records, with the goal of developing AI models for real-time patient monitoring, prognosis prediction, and personalized treatment planning. I have authored more than 40 peer-reviewed publications in leading medical AI journals (_npj Digital Medicine_, _JMIR_) and international AI conferences (_NeurIPS_, _EMNLP_).

I am seeking highly motivated MS/PhD students and Post-docs. Please email me your CV to join our mission of advancing clinical AI üöÄ.
