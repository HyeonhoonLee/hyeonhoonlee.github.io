<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Transdisciplinary Medicine and the Healthcare AI Research Institute at Seoul National University Hospital, and an adjunct professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine. I'm also a professor in charge of the Center for Data Innovation at the National Strategic Technology Research Institute, where I help build a global healthcare data ecosystem using clinical data from Korean hospitals. I was honored to be selected as an [emerging young investigator](http://www.bosa.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=2236647) from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea in 2024 for my contributions to the advancement of healthcare technology. "In 2025, I joined the editorial team of [*npj Digital Medicine*](https://www.nature.com/npjdigitalmed/), the leading medical AI journal (IF 15.2, JCR top 1%), as an associate editor.  

My research interests span reinforcement learning, natural language processing, biosignal analysis, and multi-agent systems. By leveraging multimodal clinical data, including physiological signals, clinical texts, medical imaging, and electronic health records, I aim to develop AI models for clinical applications, such as real-time patient monitoring, prognosis prediction, and personalized treatment planning.

I have published 50+ academic papers in top medical AI journals (_npj Digital Medicine_, _JMIR_) and International AI conferences (_NeurIPS_, _EMNLP_).
